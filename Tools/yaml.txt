Absolutely! Here’s an example of a GitHub Action workflow that checks for specific text in a .docx file. This workflow uses Python with the python-docx library to read the .docx file and search for the text.
First, ensure you have a Python script (check_text.py) that performs the text checking:
# check_text.py
import sys
from docx import Document

def check_text_in_docx(file_path, search_text):
    doc = Document(file_path)
    for paragraph in doc.paragraphs:
        if search_text in paragraph.text:
            print(f"Found '{search_text}' in the document.")
            return True
    print(f"'{search_text}' not found in the document.")
    return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = sys.argv[1]
    search_text = sys.argv[2]
    if not check_text_in_docx(file_path, search_text):
        sys.exit(1)
Next, create a GitHub Action workflow file (.github/workflows/check-docx.yml):
name: Check Text in DOCX

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  check-docx:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install python-docx

    - name: Check text in DOCX
      run: |
        python check_text.py path/to/your/document.docx "search text"
Explanation:
1.	Python Script (check_text.py):
o	This script reads a .docx file and searches for a specific text.
o	If the text is found, it prints a message and exits with a status code of 0.
o	If the text is not found, it prints a message and exits with a status code of 1.
2.	GitHub Action Workflow (.github/workflows/check-docx.yml):
o	The workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests to the main branch.
o	It checks out the repository, sets up Python, installs the python-docx library, and runs the check_text.py script with the path to the .docx file and the text to search for.
Feel free to adapt the paths and search text to fit your specific needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, I'm here to help!
